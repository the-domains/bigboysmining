description: 'BIGBOYSMINING started out gold dredging in Central Otago in 1994 with a number of different dredges, each one got bigger and bigger as time went on. Now with a requirement for maneuverable high performance construction and maintenance dredging equipment BIGBOYSMINING are able to clean out old marinas making them accessible once again to pleasure and fishing vessels after having been silted up over the years. We create wetlands for processing road runoff and storm water sediments before they are discharged into our marine environment. This provides healthier food gathering environments of shellfish and our fishery resources.'
