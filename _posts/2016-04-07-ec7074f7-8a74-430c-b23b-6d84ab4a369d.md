# The submersible cutter-head pump allows for a six meter (6m) digging depth.

## Working the cuter-head in an arch methodically cutting into the sediments to your required digging depth is a systematic controlled cost effective method of moving sediments to get the clients/engineers required results. 

## With sensors positioned on the digging arm, a monitor shows the depth of the cutter-head and can be set to a 10mm tolerance to eliminate over or under dredging. 

## Managing the volume of sediment flow into the intake insures exceptional pumping distances when incorporating booster pumps.
