# [About Us][0]

BIGBOYSMINING started out gold dredging in Central Otago in 1994 with a number of different dredges, each one got bigger and bigger as time went on.

Now with a requirement for maneuverable high performance dredging equipment BIGBOYSMINING are able to clean out old marinas making them accessible once again to pleasure and fishing vessels .

Additionally creating wetlands for processing road runoff and storm water sediments before they are discharged into our marine environment provides healthier food gathering environments of shellfish and our fishery resources.
