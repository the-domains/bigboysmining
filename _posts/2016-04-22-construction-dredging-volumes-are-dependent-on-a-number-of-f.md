# Questions to ask

Factors outlining volume and speed:

* The operators ability.
* Compaction of the sediments.
* The density of the sediments.
* Sediment average size.
* The distance from the dredge to the discharge point.
* Number of booster pumps required.

## What is happening to the sediments:

* Are the sediments being pumped into geo bags for de-watering?
* Are you wanting to have flocculant's and coagulation treatments injected to speed up the de-watering process when pumped into geo bags?
* Is there a requirement to neutralize toxicity levels of sediments?
* Are there elevations to consider?
* How many corners are there between the dredge and the discharge point.
* Are the sediments to be disposed of at a landfill?

## What is the end use of the sediments:

* Do you want to create mudcreat blocks?
* Are you considering the use of the sediment to create park features or stopbanks?
* Did you know we can create a reef under water with the use of specialized bags?
