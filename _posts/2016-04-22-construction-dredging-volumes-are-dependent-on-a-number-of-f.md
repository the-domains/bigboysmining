# Questions to Ask

**Factors outlining volume and speed:**

* The operators ability.
* Compaction of the sediments.
* The density of the sediments.
* Sediment average size.
* The distance from the dredge to the discharge point.
* Number of booster pumps required.

**What is happening to the sediments:**

* Are the sediments being pumped into geo bags for de-watering?
* Are you wanting to have flocculant's and coagulation treatments injected to speed up the de-watering process when pumped into geo bags?
* Is there a requirement to neutralize toxicity levels of sediments?
* Are there elevations to consider?
* How many corners are there between the dredge and t
